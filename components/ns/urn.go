// TODO!!! format URN according to RFC

type URN common.IDStr

// https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt
//
// <URN>         ::= 1*<URN chars>
// <URN chars>   ::= <trans> | "%" <hex> <hex>
// <trans>       ::= <upper> | <lower> | <number> | <other> | <reserved>
// <hex>         ::= <number> | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" |
// "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f"
// <other>       ::= "(" | ")" | "+" | "," | "-" | "." |
// ":" | "=" | "@" | ";" | "$" |
// "_" | "!" | "*" | "'"
//
// Depending on the rules governing a namespace, valid identifiers in a namespace might contain characters that are not members
// of the URN character set above (<URN chars>).  Such strings MUST be translated into canonical URN format before using them
// as protocol elements or otherwise passing them on to other applications. Translation is done by encoding each character
// outside the URN character set as a sequence of one to six octets using UTF-8 encoding [5], and the encoding of each of those
//  octets as "%" followed by two characters from the <hex> character set above. The two characters give the hexadecimal
// representation of that octet.
//
// 2.3 Reserved characters
//
// The remaining character set left to be discussed above is the reserved character set, which contains various characters
// reserved from normal use.  The reserved character set follows, with a discussion on the specifics of why each character
// is reserved.
//
// The reserved character set is:
//
// <reserved>    ::= '%" | "/" | "?" | "#"
